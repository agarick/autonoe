## about

*autonoe* ...:

* Is a fixed-width, 7x14, bold-only, unicode, bitmap typeface.
* Has an MIT X license.
* Is in version 3.
* Has an [xlfd][xlfd] of `-agaric-autonoe-bold-r-normal--14-100-96-96-m-70-iso10646-1`.
* Is basically *fixed-7x14b* with a few modifications.
* Primarily targets shell use.
* Is Named after the Bacchic mythological character, whose sister, Agave, happens to share a name with [a font I started designing earlier](/agarick/agave). Besides the name, there is no relation between the two fonts. I like superficial coherence, that's all.
